        <h2>Abstract </h2>

    <h2>Design </h2>
<p>During July 2012, official Android, BlackBerry, and iPhone Smartphone app platform stores were searched. "Pain" was entered into the search-bar of each Smartphone app store. Of the pain apps meeting inclusion criteria, the following were retrieved: release date, download cost (US dollars [US $], file size, documentation of a healthcare professional's (HCP) involvement in app development, primary purpose of the app (pain education, pain self-management, or a combination of pain education and self-management), targeted pain-related condition(s), and inclusion of features that addressed four common self-monitoring and/or management strategies.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 220 apps meeting inclusion criteria, the majority were available through the iPhone (80.0 percent). The cost for downloading each app ranged from US $0.00 to 89.99; however, the majority of apps were â‰¤US $4.99. There was no evidence of HCP involvement in the development of the majority of apps (65.0 percent). Chronic, nonspecific pain was the focus of half (50.5 percent) of the apps, followed by back and/or neck pain (25.9 percent). The primary purpose of the apps was categorized as follows: pain education (n = 53, 24.1 percent), pain self-management (n = 137, 62.3 percent), and both pain education and self management (n = 30, 13.6 percent).</p2>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, most of the pain-related apps included within our review not only lacked evidence of HCP input regarding development but also contained few evidence-based pain management features.</p>

  <h2>Addendum</h2>
  <p>This addendum provides an explanation of the CSS styles used in this document:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
            <p><strong>Header:</strong> The header section of the page is designed to create a strong visual impact. It features a dark background color (#333) that adds contrast and draws the viewer's attention. To ensure text readability, the text color is set to white. Additionally, there is 10 pixels of padding around the content to create space, and text alignment is centered for a neat presentation. The main heading within the header uses a large 24px font size to emphasize its importance and uses the Arial font family for a clean and professional appearance.</p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Headings (h1):</strong> Subheadings in the page are highlighted with a distinctive Dark gray color (#666), which serves to emphasize and differentiate these sections from the rest of the content. The font size for h1 elements is set to 18px, making them noticeably larger and more prominent. The choice of the 'Courier New' font family adds a modern and stylish touch to the typography. A 20-pixel top margin has been added to separate the subheadings from the preceding content and further distinguish them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Subheadings (h2):</strong> Subheadings in the page are highlighted with a distinctive bright red color (#ff0000), which serves to emphasize and differentiate these sections from the rest of the content. The font size for h2 elements is set to 20px, making them noticeably larger and more prominent. The choice of the 'Georgia' font family adds a modern and stylish touch to the typography. A 10-pixel top margin has been added to separate the subheadings from the preceding content and further distinguish them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Paragraphs (p):</strong> Paragraph text is formatted with a 16px font size to ensure readability. The choice of the Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif font family lends a classic and elegant appearance to the text. A 5-pixel margin surrounds each paragraph, creating spacing and enhancing the overall structure of the page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Links (a):</strong> Links have been styled with a blue color (#007bff) to make them stand out as clickable elements. This visually guides users to recognize and interact with links. To enhance the user experience, the default underline on links has been removed using the "text-decoration: none" property. This approach provides a cleaner, more modern appearance and ensures that links are easily distinguishable from regular text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Contact Section:</strong> The final section of the page serves as a contact section. It features a white background color (#ffffff) to distinguish it from the rest of the content and draw the viewer's attention. Extra padding (10px) has been applied to this section to provide additional spacing, ensuring that it stands out visually. This separation helps guide the reader's attention to this important section, making it more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
